# Chess

Coding chess using OOP - used AI to generate the display board function. Need to improve it a bit more with a better way of typing in moves and need to add a few features such as en passant, signalling when in check, checking for checkmate, castling, turning pawns into queen's, and not being able to move pieces because of check.
